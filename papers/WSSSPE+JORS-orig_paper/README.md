Original paper:

Citation and Attribution of Digital Products: Social and Technological Concerns

Daniel S. Katz

Abstract:
The pursuit of science increasingly relies on activities that facilitate science but are not currently
rewarded or recognized. Of particular concern are the sharing of data; development of common data
resources, software, and methodologies; and annotation of data and publications. This situation has
been documented in a number of recent reports that focus on changing needs and mechanisms for
attribution and citation of digital products, from the use of alternative metrics that track popularity,
to work on data.

To promote such activities, we must develop mechanisms for assigning credit, facilitate the appropriate
attribution of research outcomes, devise incentives for activities that facilitate research, and
allocate funds to maximize return on investment. In this article, I introduce the idea of transitive
credit, which addresses the issue of crediting indirect contributions, and discuss potential solutions
to these other problems.

Extended paper:

Transitive Credit as a Means to Address Social and Technological Concerns Stemming from Citation and
Attribution of Digital Products

Daniel S. Katz

Abstract:
The pursuit of science and engineering research increasingly relies on activities that facilitate
research but are not currently rewarded or recognized, such as development of products and infrastructure.
In research publications, citations are used to credit previous works. This paper suggests that a modified
citation system that includes the technological idea of transient credit could be used to recognize the
developers of products other than research publications and that if this were done in a systematic manner,
it would lead to social and cultural changes that would provide incentives for the further development of
such products, accelerating overall scientific and engineering advances.
