Implementing Transitive Credit with JSON-LD

Daniel S. Katz, Arfon M. Smith

Abstract:
Science and engineering research increasingly relies on activities that facilitate research but are not
currently rewarded or recognized, such as: data sharing; developing common data resources, software and
methodologies; and annotating data and publications. To promote and advance these activities, we must
develop mechanisms for assigning credit, facilitate the appropriate attribution of research outcomes,
devise incentives for activities that facilitate research, and allocate funds to maximize return on
investment. In this article, we focus on addressing the issue of assigning credit for both direct and
indirect contributions, specifically by using JSON-LD to implement a prototype transitive credit system.
